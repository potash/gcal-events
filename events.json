   "description": "WHAT IS A BIOBLITZ?\nWhile traditional bioblitzes typically involve biologists/experts in each taxonomic field (botanists, ornithologists, herpetologists, oligochaetologists?) making collections of each plant or animal to submit to museums or herbaria over a 24 hour period, ours will be more informal. No formal training is required, and no collections will be made. We will be using the website/smartphone app iNaturalist (www.inaturalist.org) to document each individual we find. Can't identify something? Don't worry! We and the iNaturalist community at large will help with any unknown identifications. \n\nIf you have a smartphone, great! Download the iNaturalist app (for both Android & iPhone), make an account, and try it out beforehand. If you don't have a smartphone, don't worry. You can report observations using the website directly, by uploading photos and pinpointing on a map where you observed the individual. I actually prefer this method since my phone doesn't take very good photos.\n\nDATE & TIME:\nSaturday, September 14th\n9AM - 4PM\n\nIf you can't make it out in the morning, feel free to drop by for lunch at noon and afternoon bioblitzing.\n\nLUNCH:\nWe will have a potluck lunch at noon, so bring something to share. \n\nLOCATION:\nBunker Hill Savanna at Tonty & Cadwell, Niles, IL: http://goo.gl/maps/xaTo7\n\nMORE INFORMATION:\nArticle about Bunker Hill by Jane Balaban: http://www.chicagowildernessmag.org/CW_Archives/issues/spring2001/IWbunkerhill.html\nThe Grassroots Bioblitz: http://blogs.kqed.org/science/2013/05/17/smartphone-apps-enable-a-new-phenomenon-the-grassroots-bio-blitz/\niNaturalist observations at Bunker Hill: http://www.inaturalist.org/places/bunker-hill-forest-preserve-niles-il\n\n\nFacebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/171200273064661/\nMeetup Link: http://www.meetup.com/Habitat-2030-Young-Chicagoans-Who-Love-Nature/events/138844962/",

   "description": "Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/545130768874871/\n\nHey Habitat 2030 Volunteers!\nAlmost 9 years ago, a few tree-hugging, Chicago-dwelling, twenty/thirtysomethings like ourselves hatched a crazy idea: build a community of young men and women interested in exploring, celebrating, and protecting globally-imperiled local nature. Acutely aware of Homo Sapiens var. Twentysomethingus’s propensity to stay up late on Friday, melt in the presence of Saturday morning sunlight, and congregate with other twentysomethings for good cheer and beer, these wise young adults declared, “No Habitat 2030 event shall take place before noon on a Saturday. Anyone proposing such an event shall be required to sing a Nickelback song at the next get together.”\n\nFor those of you who enjoy the soul-crushing sound of a Saturday morning alarm or Daniel’s rendition of “How You Remind Me,” we give you Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, a science-y webcomic we think you’ll enjoy. For some of us, reading SMBC is as close as we get to being active on an actual Saturday morning.\n\nFellow Chordeiles minors -- er, Nighthawks -- please join us in celebrating the return of the PM workday and the intensity of a prairie in late summer as we return to Indian Road Woods Forest Preserve on Saturday, August 31st for an afternoon of exploring, prairie resto, and conversation! Plan to stuck around after the workday for a grill-out and potluck! \n\nAs always, bring a friend. Bring some grub. Better yet: bring a friend who brings some grub. Fermented beverages are welcome, but no glass containers, please. The FPDCC doesn’t allow it, and we’re not really that classy anyway.\n\nThis event will run from noon until 3 PM, with the potluck to follow.\n\nIf you can let us know if you’re thinking of coming, that’d be great, but last-minute drop-ins are always welcome! Details/ directions below.\n\n\nFinally, here's a quick peek at a few of the Habitat 2030 events on-deck for later this summer/fall:\nSeptember Bioblitz @ Bunker Hill Forest Preserve (Niles, IL)-- Stay tuned on facebook for updates!\n9/28: Restoration get together & Potluck at TBD (National Public Lands Day)\nOctober 11th-12th: Camping/hiking/restoration trip at Illinois Beach SP (Zion)\nOctober ??, Spooky Halloween gullywalking citizen science hike & picnic, site TBD\nNov. 16th, Fall festival, potluck, and bonfire!!!!!!! Site TBD\nDecember ??, Solstice bonfire and potluck, Site TBD\n\nLook for more information about these -- and more events -- in the near future!\n\n\nCheers,\nThe Habitat 2030 Team\n\nFind us on Facebook! Just search for “Habitat 2030.”\n\n\n***\n\n\nDetails\nAll you need is a pair of tough shoes/boots, a sweatshirt if it’s cold, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, a water bottle, and a hat. Come rain, cold, or shine—we only stop work in downpours and lightning storms. Feel free to pass on this email to other folks who might be interested. If you want to find someone near you who wants to carpool, please e-mail us. On the day of the event, you can call (847) 309-5234 if you’re lost or have last-minute questions.\n\nDirections:\nFrom the north: Take I-94 South to exit 39A Toughy Ave West. Continue on W Toughy Ave. Make a left onto Carpenter Road. Continue onto Central Ave. Enter the Forest Preserve drive that lies just north of Indian Road on the east side of Central Avenue. Follow the drive all the way to the end, to the parking lot. Park by the Ecological Restoration Kiosk. \n\nFrom the south: Take I-90 W/Interstate 94 W towards Wisconsin. Keep left to continue on I-90 W, follow signs for Interstate 90 W/Kennedy Expressway/O'Hare/Rockford. Take 83B toward Central Ave 5600 W. Merge onto Central Ave. Enter the Forest Preserve drive that lies just north of Indian Road, on the east side of Central Avenue. Follow the drive all the way to the end, to the parking lot.

   "description": "Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/282082315264540/\n\nJoin us on Chicago's lakefront for a dune habitat workday and bbq/swimming! \n\nMontrose Beach Dunes were restored (or actually rediscovered) in the 1990s when several native dune species were discovered. The City of Chicago stopped grooming the area, resulting in the formation of ridges, swales, and a large dune along the beach. Starting in 2001, high-quality native species were planted on-site to supplement the remnant vegetation that was starting to thrive. Now, it is home to rare migrating shorebirds, and an important rest stop for other migrating species. \n\nHelp Habitat 2030 keep this vibrant and unique ecosystem healthy for all of its inhabitants. We will be primarily weeding invasive species, watering young black oaks and jack pines if conditions are hot and dry, removing trash, and repairing fences and caging around sensitive plants. Habitat tours will be offered for anyone interested! Binoculars are strongly encouraged as many resident and migratory shorebirds will be around. \n\nUnlike other workdays, when you get all sweaty and can only refresh yourself by drinking water, this workday will allow us the chance to swim in it! We will be BBQing (please bring anything to grill or share) and swimming until whenever we feel like. Come and go as you please. Please tell anyone and everyone you know!\n\n\nDirections and parking instructions for Montrose Beach Dunes: \n\nThe dunes are located at the far east end of Montrose Beach in Cook County. If driving, take Lake Shore Drive and exit at Montrose Avenue. Travel east along the harbor as the road winds to the right. There you will see a flagpole next to a beach house and wide beach. As you approach the beach, facing the lake, the dune habitat is to your right, between the concrete fishing pier and the handicapped ramp that divides the beach. It is the only vegetated portion of Montrose Beach. Bicycle riders, there is a lockup at the beach house. \nFor public parking, park anywhere you can find space along the curb. \nFor reserved parking, when arriving at Montrose by car, enter the recreational area at Montrose Avenue and Lake Shore Drive. Tell the Traffic Management Authority personnel (TMA) stationed there that you are attending a dune stewardship workday. They will let you in no matter how crowded Montrose is. If you have any problems gaining entry to the recreational area call Park District Security at 312-747-2193 and they will ensure your entry. Proceed east to the dunes and obtain a free parking pass from us (a designated volunteer will have the folder of passes). Place this on your dashboard and you park for free. The 25 spaces will not be in a specific block inside the parking lot; so you can park wherever you find a space.\n\nHave any questions? Email us at habitat2030@gmail.com, let us know on the Habitat 2030 Facebook page, or call Daniel Suarez at (773) 415-3197 with any questions. ",

   "description": "Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/351614698275039/\n\nSomme Prairie Grove -- our longtime prairie home base -- is GLORIOUS right now! Please join us -- and the bastard toadflax -- at this storied preserve on Saturday, July 20th, from 9:00 a.m. - noon for prairie plant seed collection and probably the best wildflower walk you’ll ever experience. Plan to stick around after the workday for a \"cool drinks & treats\" potluck. Jonathan Schlesinger has already offered to make Alpukats, a refreshing avocado/chocolate beverage he first tried on the streets of Indonesia! Please bring your own refreshing/cool/icy/sweet treat or beverage to share. Those of us Habitat 2030 members all about livin’ it easy, after all.\n\nIf you can let us know if you’re thinking of coming, that’d be great, but last-minute drop-ins are always welcome! \n\nNote: Most Habitat 2030 workdays begin at 1 p.m. This event, however, begins at 9 a.m., so be sure to set the alarm!\n\n\nCheers,\nThe Habitat 2030 Team\n\n\nDetails\nAll you need is a pair of tough shoes/boots, a sweatshirt if it’s cold, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, a water bottle, and a hat. Come rain, cold, or shine—we only stop work in downpours and lightning storms. Feel free to pass on this email to other folks who might be interested. If you want to find someone near you who wants to carpool, please e-mail us. On the day of the event, you can call (847) 309-5234 if you’re lost or have last-minute questions.\n\nDirections: Somme Prairie Grove sits west of Waukegan Ave on the north side of Dundee Rd, while Somme Woods lies on the east side. The workday meeting place for both sites is the Forest Preserve parking lot on the north side of Dundee, just east of Waukegan.\nDirections via public transit:\nTRAIN: Take a Fox Lake, Deerfield or Grayslake (Milwaukee District North Line) train to Northbrook. Walk northeast on Shermer Road 1/3 block to Meadow Road. Walk north on Meadow Road about one mile to Dundee Road. The preserve begins at Dundee. There are entrances to the footpath system across Dundee from Meadow and, if there's traffic, about a block west (where a mid-road island makes it easy to cross by the railroad tracks). \nBUS: Take PACE bus number 422 to Dundee Road. At the northwest corner of Waukegan and Dundee, you'll find the entrance to the preserve trail marked with signs and an information box.\n\nGoogle Maps: http://goo.gl/maps/44A9D",

   "description": "We’re migrating south for the winter again! Voyage with us to the far southeast side of Chicago this Saturday, January 19, 9am – 12pm, to join our fellow “next generation” site steward, Alice Brandon, at her first workday of 2013 at the fabulous Powderhorn Prairie Nature Preserve. \n\nOkay, so while this migration won’t exactly get us far enough south to catch a balmy breeze off the ocean while we lay on warm sand on a subtropical beach somewhere, we will generate our OWN heat (and burn calories!) by chopping down invasive shrubs and trees and throwing them on a nice, big, VERY hot brushpile fire.\n\nAlice is bringing hot dogs and her dutch oven, so feel free to bring something to add to the pot! …Or something to skewer and toast over the flames...or something to wrap up in foil and roast in the coals.... It might just end up being a feast! \n\nPlease RSVP by noon-ish on Friday so we can get Alice a head count for tools and gloves and such. Please let us know by Friday if you’d like help finding a ride or if you can offer a seat to someone in your car. \n\nDirections are below. Call Alice the morning of the workday if you need helping finding the site or if you happen to arrive after the group has already walked out into the prairie and she'll send someone out to guide you to where the group is working. Alice’s cell is 312-286-6937.\n\nPlease bring your own drinking water and dress for the weather; layers are recommended. Gloves and tools are provided. Below is more information about what to wear/bring and about the work we’ll be doing. Hope to see you around the fire! \n\nCheers,\nThe Habitat 2030 Team\n\n****\n\nDetails\nAll you need is a pair of tough shoes/boots, a sweatshirt if it’s cold, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, a water bottle, and a hat. We recommend against nylon or other synthetic fabrics, as sparks from the fire will melt holes in them.\n\nCome rain, cold, or shine—we only stop work in downpours and lightning storms, and the fire’ll keep ya warm!\n\nFeel free to pass on this email to other folks who might be interested. If you want to find someone near you who wants to carpool, please e-mail us.\n\nOn the day of the event, feel free to call the hotline at 312-286-6937 if you’re lost or have last-minute questions.\n\n\n\nDirections\nPowderhorn Prairie is located at 14001 Brainard Avenue on the far southeast side of Chicago. From downtown Chicago, take the Dan Ryan Expressway (I-94) south past 95th Street. Stay in the left lane when it splits and continue south (or east, as the signs say) on the Bishop Ford Expressway (I-94). Take exit 68B for 130th Street East. At the end of the off ramp, turn left and follow 130th Street east about a mile and a half. Once you pass Torrence Avenue, turn right at the next stop light onto Saginaw/Brainard. Follow the road as it curves to the left. Once you pass Burnham Avenue, take the next left at the Forest Preserve District sign into the Powderhorn parking lot. Continue north to the far end of the parking lot, where the group will gather before heading out into the prairie. Call Alice Brandon if have trouble finding the site or if you get there after the group has headed in and she’ll send someone out to guide you to where the group is working. Alice’s cell is 312-286-6937. ",

Will it be the same-old jewel-encrusted Cadillac Escalade that you gave them last year? Or the handful of Yanni cassette tapes you bought at the gas station the year before? Or that not-so-romantic February balloon ride/haircut?\n\nThis year, maybe it’s time to think outside the box. Consider giving your schmoopy* a 3700-acre wooded estate in northwest Cook County, called Busse Woods. You could drive them down a lovely wooded lane, and get out and say “Let’s join those people with saws and loppers, and cut some brush.”\n\nAnd your mate would swoon, knowing that you are both going to do the hottest thing you’ve ever done together: restore biodiversity.\n\nAfterwards, you would enjoy chili (provided by the site steward) and then dip things in a big pot of liquid chocolate. You would tell your lover, “The French pronounce it fondue,” and she would swoon for a second time.\n\nIf you think this would make a good pre-Valentine’s Day gift, come join us!\n\nIf you can let us know if you’re thinking of coming, that will help us figure out how many tools, as well as how much chocolate fondue, to bring.\n\nCheers,\nThe Habitat 2030 Team\n\n*or whatever you call him or her.

   "description": "We are kicking off a collaboration with UIC's Woodworth Prairie! This should be a great opportunity to expand our connections in the community, tour a carefully maintained native prairie, gain a new worksite, spend some time outside the city, and get our foot in the door with an eye toward recruiting more UIC students in the future.\nWe'll be removing some construction debris like concrete and signposts set in concrete, plus any invasives we find, as well as doing some seed collecting for next season! They have some volunteers of their own who may be there, so now's a great time to plug H2030!\nAfterwards, let's plan on pot lucking an early dinner at the nearby Beck Lake.\n\nDirections: \n\nFrom the north-side: Take Clark St. north until it becomes Chicago Ave. Turn left on Emerson St. just before Northwestern's campus. Emerson becomes Golf Rd. Take Golf west to Milwaukee. Turn left on Milwaukee, the Preserve is next door to a McDonald's.\n\nFrom the west-side/south-side: Take the Kennedy (I-90/94) north. Exit onto Edens (I-94). Exit on Dempster West. Follow Dempster to Milwaukee, turn left, the Preserve is next door to a McDonald's.\n\nParking for 8 cars is available at the Preserve. Overflow parking is available at the McDonald's next door.\n\nWhat to bring: Closed-toed shoes and food for pot lucking. If anyone has a sledgehammer, it would be useful for breaking up concrete. Habitat and JWP will provide the tools.\n\nFacebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/576753265717591\nMeetup Event: http://www.meetup.com/Habitat-2030-Young-Chicagoans-Who-Love-Nature/events/143209142/",

The annual North Branch Seed Processing event is a great way to meet many of the North Branch stalwarts that have made it what it is today. This is a great opportunity to see close-up the beautiful rare seeds that will be, like Habitat 2030, the next generation of the North Branch. Taken from the North Branch website (northbranchrestoration.org):\n\nSEED PROCESSING\n\nSaturday, November 23, 2013\n9am – 1pm \nEmily Oaks Nature Center\n4650 Brummel, Skokie\n\nOver the growing season, dedicated volunteers have carefully harvested ripe native seed to help restore the plant communities in Cook County forest preserves along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Seed will be released from capsules and berries, then put into a dozen different mixes based on habitat. North Branch site stewards will distribute the mixes in North Branch preserves, helping to insure healthy thriving natural areas.\n\nPlease send us an email if you plan to join in this fun annual event. or if you have questions.. Drinks and snacks will be provided. Feel free to bring a favorite dish to share.\n\nRSVP to northbranch@comcast.net",

   "description": "Due to poor weather conditions, this event has been postponed.\n\nHabitat restoration & potluck — lop and saw buckthorn and other invasive shrubs, then enjoy a bonfire, ghost stories, and s'mores.\nPlease bring food to share at our potluck! Musically inclined members can bring an instrument to play around the fire as well.\n\nGoogle Maps: https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?mid=z_6SIh-DwHbA.kCMBuIn4zufU - we will meet at the NORTH end of MEADOW RD in Northbrook. Meadow is in between the railroad tracks and Waukegan Rd. \n\n****** Do NOT park in the Somme Woods Parking Lot!!!!!! You will get towed if you stay after dark!!!****\n\nBy Car: Meadow Rd is just west of Waukegan Road (Route 43) and south of Dundee Road. If you are coming from the east: There is an exit for Dundee Road for those taking the Edens. \n\nBy Train: Take a Fox Lake, Deerfield or Grayslake (Milwaukee District North Line) train to Northbrook. Walk northeast on Shermer Road 1/3 block to Meadow Road. Walk north on Meadow Road about one mile to Dundee Road. The preserve begins at Dundee. There are entrances to the footpath system across Dundee from Meadow and (if there's traffic) about a block west by the railroad tracks (where a mid-road island makes it easier to cross Dundee.)\n\nBy Bus: Take the PACE bus number 422 to Dundee Road (please check the schedule.) At the northwest corner of Waukegan and Dundee, you'll find the entrance to the preserve trail marked with signs and an information box.\n\nDetails\nAll you need is a pair of tough shoes/boots, a sweatshirt if it’s cold, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, a water bottle, and a hat. Come rain, cold, or shine—we only stop work in downpours and lightning storms. Feel free to pass on this email to other folks who might be interested. If you want to find someone near you who wants to carpool, please e-mail us. On the day of the event, you can call (847) 309-5234 if you’re lost or have last-minute questions.\n\nWhat We Do and Why\nGuided by longtime, highly knowledgeable site stewards, and in coordination with the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, we'll be collecting conservative prairie species. We want to ensure that native flowers, trees, and all the species that depend on them can thrive in their natural habitat. As we’ve mentioned before, we've purposely invited mostly 20-, 30-, and 40-somethings (both single and hitched) because it's time to create our own niche in the vibrant culture of habitat restoration. It's an amazing place and time to learn, have fun, and reconnect.\n\nFacebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/610623442312460\n",

This non-native shrub forms dense thickets, transforming our naturally open woodlands into unwalkable messy thickets and choking out good native plants. It even releases a chemical that is toxic to frogs, and may be contributing to their population decline!

We'll get things started with a potluck and brews, and then fire-up the telly for a photographic introduction to common Spring Flora of the Chicago Region.  Finally, we'll wrap-up the evening with a botany slide-in; we'll show you a few dozen photos of plants native to Northern Illinois and see who can correctly identify the greatest number of these gems.  Either common or scientific name will be accepted.  Whether you are a professional ecologist eager to win the prestigious (but yet to be determined) trophy or a newbie naturalist eager to learn a few more plants before the snow melts, the slide-in promises to be educational, fun, and very entertaining.\n\nNeed to brush up on native plants?  Check out Jonathan Schlesinger's website, Botanizing Chicago Wilderness: https://sites.google.com/site/botanizingchicagowilderness/. Tip: The resources page will take you to fantastic learning resources!\n\nNo, you don't need to bring your Mycology Diva glass to this event, but please do bring a beverage, entree, or dessert to share!\n\nLocation: The Habitat 2030 Northside bunker.

Lisa Culp has been a citizen science volunteer for the past 5 ½ years through the Chicago Botanic Garden’s Plants of Concern program and orchid monitoring with Fish and Wildlife Service. She is also a full-time professional tennis player. Jonathon Schlesinger is the co-director of Habitat 2030, a volunteer group of “young-ish” scientists who act as stewards of the land and also monitor and collect data on a wide variety of wildlife.\n\nWe hope you will join us for this free event at the Firehouse Grill and learn how you can become a part of a large group of citizen scientists serving our Chicagoland area!",

All you need is a pair of tough shoes or boots, a sweatshirt and coat if it’s cold, long pants, long-sleeved shirt, a water bottle, and a hat. We strongly recommend against nylon or other synthetic fabrics, as sparks from the fire will melt holes in them. \n\nBring a dish/drink/snack to share afterwards around the fire.\n\nAs always, don't be afraid to ask for a ride on our Facebook event (or email habitat2030@gmail.com).

   "description": "Come join Habitat 2030 as we embark on our next educational endeavor! \n\nHops n' Herps, a followup to our successful Beer n' Botany event, will focus on learning about the amphibians of the Chicago Region and how you can help monitor them as part of Habitat 2030's Ephemeral Ponds Project. We will be showing a slideshow prepared by the Calling Frog Survey, and will be playing frog calls from their educational CD. We also may include some information about salamanders and plants. \n\nThe \"Hops\" is not only a clever reference to frogs, but is an invitation to bring along beer and/or snacky food to share. Gluten-free snacks/dessert things (not beer) are encouraged, as our gracious host (a Martial Arts Dojo! http://gatchicago.com/) is gluten-free and is letting us use the space for free!\n\nThis is a perfect time to get acquainted with Habitat 2030 and the Ephemeral Ponds Project, which is a long-term study of ephemeral ponds in the Cook County Forest Preserves along the North Branch of the Chicago River. There is no experience or previous knowledge required to participate. For more information, please put your name down on our mailing list to stay in the loop on the many activities we'll be doing this spring and summer:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AheYyT23jLUMdE5RZjgwMVZTM09TZGxyaHY4Q0dYdXc&usp=sharing\n\n\"Hop\" to see you there!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/693498087355226/\n",

   "description": "Come celebrate glorious spring with a Spring Wildflower Hike at Harms Woods! Known to be one of the best spring wildflower sites in the region, this hike is sure to bury the bitter cold memories from this past winter, while exciting us for the start of our growing season. \n\nBecome familiar with an amazing woodland, where decades of restoration work have created habitat for a host of rare plant and animal species. Get to know people just like you, who are interested in learning and helping care for our shared natural heritage. \n\nDon't know anything about plants? GOOD! We’ll be sure to create a positive learning environment for everyone, where more experienced folks can share their knowledge with newbies. North Branch Restoration Project volunteer stewards will also be present. They are valuable mentors for all of Habitat 2030, and are an amazing source of information about our prairie, savanna, woodland, and wetland ecosystems. \n\nHikes will be offered at 9 am, 11 am, and 1 pm. This event is open to the general public, but it would be great if Habitat 2030 can stick together, so let us know if you're planning on attending the 11 am or 1 pm slot. Or, if you're a morning person, let us know if you're thinking about the 9 am slot and we'll discuss. \n\nPark at \"Glenview Woods\" parking lot on Harms Road, just south of Glenview Road: https://goo.gl/maps/aOGR7\n\nIf that lot is full, park in the Harms Woods parking lot at the intersection of Harms Road and Old Orchard Road: https://goo.gl/maps/J2CU5. \n\nPlease dress for the weather. Be sure to bring a water bottle, sunscreen and bug spray. Binoculars are also encouraged, as Harms should be abuzz with migratory warblers!\nIf you have questions or want to carpool, comment below or send an email to habitat2030@gmail.com.",

   "summary": "Somme Woods East Excursion",
   "description": "By now, many Habitat 2030ers know that the Sommes (Somme Prairie Nature Preserve, Somme Prairie Grove, and Somme Woods) are a very special place. These preserves, contain some of the highest quality prairies, savannas, and woodlands in the Chicago region. \n\nTheir status as important centers of biodiversity was earned; it has taken close to 40 years of intensive restoration work to make these areas what they are, and the work is not done yet. \n\nOn Sunday, May 18th, we will begin the next chapter of restoration at Somme: Somme East. This area encompasses the eastern portion of Somme Woods, where restoration has been underway for quite some time. Due to the immensity of Somme Woods (over 200 acres), Somme East has not gotten the restoration attention it deserves, but Habitat 2030 can change that. \n\nJoin us for an exploratory hike around Somme East. Led by Stephen Packard, steward at Somme Prairie Grove and Habitat 2030 mentor, we'll discover the ecosystems of Somme East, and meet the plants and animals that call this place home. Massive oaks, flying squirrels, and rare plants will be found, and there are sure to be other surprises!\n\nRestoration work will begin at Somme East in the fall. We need to really get to know this place if we want the restoration to be effective. We'll spend a lot of time discussing the challenges facing Somme East, and how best Habitat 2030 can contribute to create as much habitat for plants and animals as quickly as possible. Don't have any experience with restoration but are eager to learn? This is a perfect opportunity to explore the concept of ecological restoration and how this important work gets accomplished. Have restoration experience but are eager to play a bigger role? Come on out and learn how you can help lead this effort. \n\nPark at the end of the Somme Woods parking lot: https://goo.gl/maps/ulhHx Please dress for the weather, and bring along a water bottle. If you've got binoculars, be sure to bring them, as we're sure to catch some spring migrants making their way up north. \n\nIf you have questions or want to carpool, comment on Facebook or send an email to habitat2030@gmail.com. If you have questions the day of the event, contact Daniel Suarez at (773) 415-3197.\n\nFacebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/1421019894833441",

   "description": "Ever seen that Totem Pole in Chicago by the Lakefront Bike Path? Ever look PAST it? Well, read on...\n\nAll of our natural areas are unique, and have a character of their own. Bill Jarvis Migratory Bird Sanctuary is no exception. It is a 7+ acre site on the lakefront, owned by the Chicago Park District, and completely surrounded by an 8-foot tall fence. As you can imagine, this helps preserve some of the plant diversity, and gives those birds a place to rest. There are a couple of pond areas, with hand-built gravel bridges, newly-opened-up savanna areas, and a nice shed to get out of the sun.\n\nProjects will include: \n-light brush cutting \n-garlic mustard and Japanese hedge parsley removal \n-invasive cattail and yellow iris removal \n-transplanting a small swamp white oak -exploration of this beautiful preserve along the lakefront\n\nBring some water and wear long pants -- the vegetation might be thick in some places by June. Binoculars would be helpful too if you want to peep at some birds.\n\nDirections: Google Maps link: https://goo.gl/maps/SfzzG\n\nFrom Irving Park Rd. and Lake Shore Dr., go east on Irving, towards the fenced-in golf course, then follow the curve south onto Recreation Dr. Follow it past all the tennis courts, then take the first left. Go all the way to the back (east) end of the parking lot. Park, then walk down the service drive on the southeast corner until you get to the shed. Get a parking pass and put it in your window so you can park free. If you are coming from the south, headed northbound on LSD, you can exit at Recreation Dr., and go left (north) and you will see the entrance to the parking lot on the right.

Two of Habitat 2030's founding members are now apprentice stewards at Bunker Hill and they need our help!  Garlic Mustard's little white flowers are starting to whither, and seed pods are already forming. Each day that passes, Garlic Mustard become harder and harder to find in a sea of green. Since each plant can produce hundreds (if not thousands) of seeds, it is vital to pull each plant we can find, especially in the highest quality areas. \n\nAs always, EXPERIENCE IS NOT REQUIRED. We'll walk the woods, pulling Garlic Mustard as we find it, and explore and discuss ecology/nature/plants/animals/whatever as we go along. \n\nTough boots and a water bottle are encouraged.\n\nEnter Bunker Hill at Caldwell Ave. and Tonty and park in the first parking area (https://goo.gl/maps/FVT9c). \n\nIf you have questions or want to carpool, send an email to habitat2030@gmail.com.",

   "description": "Montrose Beach is a super high quality habitat in Chicago on the Lake at Montrose. There's a little bit of everything here -- multiple habitats, endangered/threatened plants, shorebirds, birds that fly out from the Magic Hedge, butterflies, dragonflies, etc. Many sites can boast of such diversity, but they are usually out in the suburbs, not this far into the city of Chicago.\n\nWe typically pull weeds, which, at Montrose, are typically tons of 6\" cottonwood seedlings, but other random weeds pop up, like sweet clover. Nothing too strenuous, and we use a hand tool for the more stubborn ones.\n\nThe steward of Montrose Beach Dunes, Leslie Borns, gives a tour of the site, which is fascinating for its diversity. There are usually lots of other volunteers, who tend to be younger than other sites, so we all just chat and socialize while pulling weeds. There's a tent for shade, plenty of water, and they usually have food, but we can bring our own potluck, too, to share. It also happens to be right next to the beach volleyball nets. Coincidentally, Habitat 2030 went there last July, and everyone loved it -- stewards, volunteers, and H2030 members alike.\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/events/328235437345999",

   "description": "Eager to play a bigger role in Habitat 2030, restoration, or stewardship in general? Come on out to LaBagh/Hernandez Woods this weekend to take part in an historic endeavor!\n\nHabitat 2030 has the chance to play a leading role in a restoration effort starting from the ground up!\n\nSimilar to our Somme East Exploratory Hike in May, Habitat 2030 will explore this newly established restoration site, located within the city of Chicago! We'll discuss what it takes to start a restoration project, some of the challenges facing LaBagh/Hernandez, and the roles that need to be filled by Habitat 2030 to make this project sustainable in the long-term. \n\nCompletely brand-new to restoration? Wonderful! NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED. To successfully restore an ecosystem, we must successfully create a community from the ground up. There is a role available for anyone who wants to have one. \n\nWe'll look at the plants, animals, insects, trees, fungi, birds that make LaBagh/Hernandez an urban oasis.

   "description": "Over the growing season, dedicated volunteers have carefully harvested ripe native seed to help restore the plant communities in Cook County forest preserves along the North Branch of the Chicago River. Seed will be released from capsules and berries, then put into a dozen different mixes based on habitat. North Branch site stewards will distribute the mixes in North Branch preserves, helping to insure healthy thriving natural areas.\n\nIn keeping with the communal aspect of processing millions of native seeds, a potluck will be held. Please bring a dish to share if you are interested in participating.  Of course, you can also count on the requisite exploratory hike through the 13 acre savanna that makes up Emily Oaks.\n\nDirections to Emily Oaks Nature Center: from Skokie Blvd/Cicero Ave, go east on Howard St. to Knox Ave. Turn north on Knox, go two blocks to Brummel St. Turn west and go one block to the parking area at the Nature Center, on the north side of Brummel. Follow the signs to the processing area.",

With the guidance of steward Pete Jackson, we'll help clear buckthorn, honeysuckle, barberry, oriental bittersweet, and any other invasive brush we come across to benefit the several rare, threatened, and endangered plant and animal species that call Deer Grove West home. This beautiful, massive, 1,800 acre site contains varied habitats such as maple-lined ravines, wetlands, and ancient oak woodlands. \n\nThis is the first of many workdays we hope to have in the NW suburbs, so all of you Habitat 2030ers in that part of the county, please spread the word!\n\nFor more info on DGW: http://fpdcc.com/deer-grove/\nhttp://deergrove.freehostia.com/\n\nDirections: Entrance to DGW is on Quentin Road, just north of Dundee Road in Palatine. Once you enter, turn right at the stop sign, and continue straight to the circle turnaround. \nhttps://goo.gl/maps/L1ocU\n\nAs always, NO EXPERIENCE IS REQUIRED. Any and all are welcome, and we will orient those who are new to restoration. Please wear sturdy boots, and avoid wearing synthetic fabrics (i.e. nice North Face, Patagonia, and Columbia jackets) as the raging bonfire can burn holes in these materials. \n\nLeave a message on FB or Meetup if you'd like to carpool, or email habitat2030@gmail.com. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/372365892937824\n\nFor questions the day of, contact Daniel Suarez at 773-415-3197.",

   "description": "A huge amount of work has been accomplished at LaBagh Woods over the last few months, so let's take a special trek across the river to Sauganash Prairie Grove to help out the longtime stewards Larry Hodack and Pete Leki. \n\nLarry and Pete have been restoring Sauganash for decades, and are eager to have us help them out for this workday. There is a great example of adjacent restored sections of 8, 4, 2, and 1 years old. This will be an important look into the future of LaBagh/Hernandez and what we can accomplish with continued work. This is an exciting learning opportunity from professional restorationists and great leaders. \n\n*Note: this workday is from 9am to noon! Wake up early folks! \n\n**Second Note: we will be meeting once again at the Irene Hernandez Parking lot off of Foster Avenue. This is a one off. The next workday will resume over at the Cicero Lot.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/events/1033036870070068/permalink/1033037913403297/",

   "summary": "Bill Jarvis Migratory Bird Sanctuary Workday",
   "description": "Time for another workday at Jarvis! Bill Jarvis Migratory Bird Sanctuary is a 7+ acre Chicago Park District site on the lakefront at Addison. I used to stop during my bike ride and rest in front of that totem pole, and had no idea such an awesome place was 100 feet away.\n\nOne really good (and unique) thing about Jarvis is that there is an 8-foot fence around the whole site. This keeps out people except when there is a volunteer workday. So this is a good chance to get in there and look around. We'll probably be cutting brush and maybe an ash or two. They've been trying to open the canopy more, which has only helped their remarkable plant diversity. We'll go back in summer again to see the fruits of everyone's labor.\n\nThey also have a shed to warm up in and pretty awesome refreshments. Their workdays run from 9-2-ish, but I picked 10-1 for the official time. That gives plenty of time for those of us going to the Winter Summit at night to get ready...\n\nDirections (by car):\n\nFrom Irving Park Rd. and Lake Shore Dr., go east on Irving, towards the fenced-in golf course, then follow the curve right (south) onto Recreation Dr. Follow it past tennis courts, then a bike repair stand, then more tennis courts, until you see a paved driveway on the left and a sign for golf course parking. Turn in there. You will have to cross the bike path to do this. (Don't hit any bicyclists! Or dogs! Or kids! Roller bladers, well...) Go all the way to the back (east) end of the parking lot. Park, then walk down the service drive on the southeast corner of the parking lot until you get to the shed. Get a parking pass and put it in your window so you can park free.\n\nIf you are coming from the south, headed northbound on LSD, you can exit at Recreation Dr., and go left (north) and you will see the entrance to the parking lot on the right. If you see the tennis courts, you went too far.\n\nIf you get confused, look for the totem pole! Jarvis is the fenced-in area between the totem pole and the lake.",

This workday will be a bit different from the days in the past. We will be thinning some invasive pole trees near the pond (or 'slough'). These trees are various species that grow tall and fast and quickly shade out all of our great grasses, wildflowers, shrubs, and oak seedlings. We don't remove all of them, but thin them strategically. These have been marked prior to the workday so you won't have to worry about cutting something by mistake. It is also a nice change from the usual buckthorn cutting. \n\nWe will be meeting at the usual spot off of Cicero (LaBagh Woods entrance on Cicero Ave just north of Foster). The workday starts at noon and will go until 3pm. Feel free to bring snacks to share, or just yourself. We provide all of the tools and instruction.

Come learn about why the Calumet Region is so unique--and why it needs volunteers to restore it. We’ll work alongside the Student Conservation Association, identify plants, and kick it around a bonfire.\n\nThe main Whistler parking lot is closed due to buckled pavement. You can park along 134th Street or in the second Whistler parking lot, also on 134th, below the old driving range. http://fpdcc.com/location/whistler-woods/\n\nNo experience necessary. Carpooling is encouraged. Connect here if you need a ride. \n\nFor questions the day of, please contact Chris Weber at 773-746-5223.",

   "description": "Come join us in one of Lake County's most floristically unique preserves, Grainger Woods, for a garlic mustard eradication day! Grainger is home to over 350 native species of plants, including 36 different species of sedges! You will get to see the results of some recent canopy clearing in a rich Northern Flatwoods ecosystem, one of our rarest habitats. We welcome skilled botanists to lead smaller groups as well as anyone who would like to learn more about our native flora and help to preserve it.\n\nWe will meet at the parking lot of Wright Woods, Mettawa, IL. Wright Woods is located about a mile south of US Rt. 60/Town Line Road, at the intersection of St. Mary's and Everett. If you are coming from the Chicago area, the easiest way is to take the tollway and exit at 60/Townline Road and go west to St. Mary's, then left on St. Mary's until it continues on into the parking lot of Wright Woods, where we will gather and walk to our workday area. We will provide gloves if you don't have them; and water, juice and snacks for a midday break. We suggest wearing long sleeves and long trousers.",

   "description": "Here's something different: A tree planting workday in a Chicago Park District park, and on a weekday morning! This time we're helping out Treekeepers, a program created by Openlands more than 20 years ago to help plant and take care of urban trees, both in parks and on parkways. We will plant, mulch, and water trees in this park centrally located on the north side on Irving Park Rd. between I-90/94 and Elston Ave.\n\nJust bring some water (for you, not the trees!), and all supplies and instruction will be provided. It's about 2 blocks east of I-90/94 and 2 blocks west of Elston Ave. if you're driving. If you're taking public transportation, you can get off the Blue Line L stop at Irving and walk 3 blocks east, or take the Irving Bus (#80), which stops right in front of Independence Park.\n\nTreekeepers was founded in 1991 as one of the first urban treekeeping programs in the country. It's an 8-week course where they bring in experts to teach everything from planting, pruning, and mulching to benefits of trees for people and communities to tree ID to pests and diseases, etc. Over 1500 Treekeepers have taken the course, and they planted over 1000 trees last year, mostly in Chicago. They usually have classes on the north side in Fall and the south side in Spring, plus the Morton Arboretum and Ryerson Woods. They are starting to 'branch' out, and are planning to offer classes in Lake, DuPage, and several southern Chicago counties. And certified Treekeepers are allowed to prune, mulch, and water trees in parks and parkways in the city of Chicago (with a little advance notice).",

There will be a limited number of Kankakee mallow plants available for adoption. \n\nNext Friday afternoon, Jim Louderman from the Field Museum is installing various traps in the site north of Calumet Park: Carrion, pitfall, and others. On the evening of May 9th, we will identify everything we collected in these traps and under blacklights. Come sharpen your ento skills and learn the basics of collecting and preserving insects! \n\nAs the day winds down, we'll light a fire and roast marshmallows while enjoying views of the night sky through binoculars and telescopes. \n\nPlease share this with anyone who you think might be interested! Everyone is welcome.\n\nIf you'd like to come with me next Friday to set traps, Kathleen can be reached at 847-951-8024.",

We will cut and burn these. Business as usual, but very important business. Many of the seeds we dispersed will be germinating any day now. We can't risk trampling them. \n\nWe also will have some rare and beautiful plants that need to be transplanted into areas of Somme Woods. Interested in learning how to do this? Great! Many of these were grown from seed we collected by our friends at the Chicago Botanic Garden. \n\nSpeaking of CBG, we have a special treat for this workday! Rachel Goad, Habitat 2030 member and director of the CBG's Plants of Concern program, will be leading a wildflower and spring plant ID hike following our restoration activities. Rachel is a wealth of knowledge and will show us how to identify many common and not so common woodland, savanna, and prairie plants. We will head over to Somme Prairie Grove at 1pm for this part of the day. \n\nAs always, we encourage ideas and questions about Somme East's future. Need a carpool? Post in the comments! See you on Sunday!\n\nPlease join Somme2030 for more info and pictures about Somme East.",

Turn in there. You will have to cross the bike path to do this. (Don't hit any bicyclists! Or dogs! Or kids! Roller bladers, well...) Go all the way to the back (east) end of the parking lot. Park, then walk down the service drive on the southeast corner of the parking lot until you get to the shed. Get a parking pass and put it in your window so you can park free.\n\nIf you are coming from the south, headed northbound on LSD, you can exit at Recreation Dr., and go left (north) and you will see the entrance to the parking lot on the right. If you see the tennis courts, you went too far.\n\nIf you get confused, look for the totem pole! Jarvis is the fenced-in area between the totem pole and the lake.",

   "description": "This is the stewardship portion of a huge community festival at Beaubien Woods (13400 S Doty Ave.). Last year's event had more than 600 people at it and this year there will be plenty of fun stuff to do (if you want to register for some of the special events like canoeing, visit this registration link: http://www.eventbrite.com/e/beaubien-woods-celebration-environmental-day-2015-tickets-16338113738). The celebration itself is all day and great outdoor fun.\n\nBut this particular event page is for the folks who want to help heal the forest preserve with some specific restoration activities. We'll be installing 1000 native plants and we need your many hands to make this work light! There's also some evil invasive sweet clover on the site as well, so after the planting, we will search and destroy the not-so-sweet clover.\n\nTools and plants and gloves and bugspray and sunscreen and water and snacks and a first aid kit will all be provided. Feel free to bring your own food for yourself or to share, and if you're doing the planting, dress in long pants and possibly long sleeves - prepare to get dirty!\n\nThis is a great chance to get to know a special place in the Calumet region, and once you help heal a natural area, your work is a part of that place forever. Which means that you're special too! Special people in special places - come through!",

   "description": "Our last planting at Eggers Grove (11200 S Ave E Chicago, IL) went so great, we're doing it again! Also because we've only planted 1,600 of 10,000 plants we've propagated from locally collected seed, so there's still work to do.\n\nOn the workday please meet at the Comfort Station at 10AM and then we'll walk out to the marsh and start planting. If all goes well, we'll be done by 1PM.\n\nDress in clothes you don't mind getting incredibly muddy. Tall, knee-high rubber boots are recommended if you have them. Long pants are a must and long sleeved t-shirts are also not a bad idea. And prepare for getting a lot of sun with a hat and sunscreen. We will provide tools and gloves. \n\nWe'll plan to work rain or shine, so pay attention to the forecast. There will be snacks and water, but feel free to bring your own provisions or something to share.\n\nThe first planting event was really awesome - one young person proclaimed \"I've never planted anything before!\" and I also realized that in all my restoration work, I hadn't either. Removal of invasives can be fun and is very important, but this is a wonderful chance to move that work farther forward and actually bring home the plants that should be where all the phragmites we removed was. And the wetlands shall rejoice!",

Habitat 2030 doesn't have an official entry in the parade this year (We will next year!), but there is some small chance we can still get in. If we don't march, we will watch, have a blast, look marvelous, and support Chicago's LGBTQ community. \n\nLet's represent the meaning of the green stripe in the rainbow flag (Nature of course!) by wearing green or other environment related garb. Come as over-the-top or unadorned as you wish (though... it is pride, so a little sparkle never hurt!)\n\nPublic transportation is recommended since there will be no parking. It's 5 min from the Red line Wilson stop and 10 min from the Sheridan stop. A bunch of buses are nearby too.",

We will share these seeds with North Branch sites as well as send some to Possibility Place to grow young shrubs that we will plant at LaBagh - thanks to a grant awarded to the Chicago Ornithological Society. \n\nSeveral experienced stewards and naturalists including John and Jane Balaban, Eileen Sutter and Michael Swierz will lead us to the prickly ash seeds, and most certainly let us in on some of their best tidbits about this incredible preserve. \n\nWear long pants as we may walk through brush, and bring plenty of bug spray and water. Meet at the Bunker Hill Parking Lot and if you're late, text or call 512-431-6016.

They have a lot of similarities, but they all have their own character...\n\nThere is a park south of Touhy in Chicago called Loyola Park, and this dunes is, therefore, called Loyola Park Dunes -- not associated with the university, although some students help out from time to time. Inevitably, Loyola Dunes gets compared to Montrose Dunes, but they are both different and unique. Loyola is smaller, but also less busy. There is something peaceful and tranquil about it, although the same could be said about Montrose, after you get settled into a task, and many other natural areas. But I feel Loyola is a little more so, and I am always happy I went.\n\nWe'll be doing invasives removal, which means you get to play around in the sand. Just like when you were a kid! Plus the steward, Ann Whelan, will show us around, Loyola was basically a field of Sweet Clover when she started, but now it's quite diverse.\n\nDunes are pretty rare in Illinois, so some of the plants aren't real common other places. There are also some birds and dragonflies, damselflies, butterflies, and **MILKWEED BEETLES**! (I know, I use the same pictures over and over, but I LOVE this one...)",

Volunteer stewards will lead first timers and regulars alike through woods and meadows to learn fun tidbits about the history, ecology, and habitat restoration efforts at Somme Woods. Wear sturdy shoes and clothes you can get dirty because there will be hands-on “sample” opportunities to cut invasive plants and collect precious native seeds. Come ready to learn, laugh, and meet a lively community of people, plants, and animals. Snacks generously provided by Sunset Grocery to follow.  At 10 am, gather at the parking lot for Somme Woods at 1714 Dundee Road, Northbrook. For more information, visit: www.MeetSommeWoods.org",

As it turns out, the Shooting Star Meadow of Somme Woods East is in the middle of a prairie. It certainly doesn't look like a prairie now, with so much buckthorn marring the view, but the absence of large oaks and the presence of remnant prairie species tells us it is so. \n\nLaBagh volunteers will take a field trip to Somme Woods for this community event and we will save the shooting star meadow from certain doom! Huzzah! \n\nYou may notice that this brush slaying day is a bit longer than usual. That's because we will take a nice long break in the middle for Somme and LaBagh volunteers to mingle, and we have so much to do to save these precious plants! You're encouraged to bring food to share!\n\nCarpooling will be available from the LaBagh Woods Foster parking lot at 9am - 4498 Foster Ave, Chicago. If you have a seat to share or you'd like to hitch a ride, please email cecilhyndsriddle@gmail.com so we know to expect you. Volunteers are also invited to go straight to Somme Woods at 10am.",

Stuff to know if you decide to go: http://habitat2030.org/stuff-to-know-if-you-go/\n\nWe will meet at the parking lot of Wright Woods, Mettawa, IL. Wright Woods is located about a mile south of US Rt. 60/Town Line Road, at the intersection of St. Mary's and Everett. If you are coming from the Chicago area, the easiest way is to take the tollway and exit at 60/Townline Road and go west to St. Mary's, then left on St. Mary's until it continues on into the parking lot of Wright Woods, where we will gather and walk to our workday area.\n\nWant to carpool?

   "description": "We all know that Illinois is the \"Prairie State\". But how many of us have actually stood in a vast, expansive grassland and truly felt the sublime exaltation of the prairie?\n\nNOW IS YOUR CHANCE\n\nBartel Grassland, a 1,000+ acre preserve in southern Cook County, is a rarity in our highly urbanized landscape. It has the size to support populations of rare grassland-nesting birds and to inspire awe in the minds and hearts of humans.\n\nOnly 30 minutes from downtown Chicago, Bartel is a place of great ecological importance. It is one of a handful of sites in the Chicago region that can truly give us a glimpse into the past. To stand in the middle of the Bartel prairie is to look back to a time when vast herds of bison and passenger pigeons called Chicago home. \n\nHabitat 2030 will be working to clear invasive brush and trees from the southern edge of the prairie. Recently, a pair of bald eagles has started building their nest nearby! Our work will ensure that many rare, imperiled species have more habitat to enjoy. \n\nHabitat 2030 has just recently started holding workdays in this region of the county. We KNOW there are many young, interested, and eager restorationists out there. We're relying on YOU to help spread the word and generate interest in the site. \n\nMeet in the abandoned strip mall parking lot on Vollmer Road: https://goo.gl/maps/fnAXkQmQjWD2\n\nFrom there, we'll hike up to the worksite and get to work, sawing, lopping, laughing, and eating alongside a raging bonfire. \n\nAs always, EXPERIENCE IS NOT REQUIRED. We are trying to develop the next generation of volunteer stewards of the land, and all are welcome!\n\nPlease bring a water bottle and weather-appropriate clothes. Gloves and tools will be provided. As always, please avoid wearing synthetic clothing, as embers from the fire can burn holes in the fibers. \n\nFor questions the day of, contact Daniel Suarez at 773-415-3197. \n",

This one's at Clark Park, an up-and-coming park on the Chicago River.\n\nLocated on Rockwell between Addison and Belmont, it sits right behind Lane Technical High School. They built a new field house, and a brand new boat house for rowers and a new dock for canoe launching.\n\nOpenlands' Treekeepers planted 25 trees there last year, but there is too much shade from non-native trees, so we're going to help them cut out the invasives so the ones we planted can get more light. A big group of us can make a BIG dent. Then in spring we'll plant more trees!\n\nThere's plenty of parking along Rockwell, and a small parking lot. Bring water so you can stay hydrated, sturdy shoes, and layers of clothes in case you get hot...\n\nThe list of cool things about Clark Park is very long. Here's a few:\n\n- On the Chicago River\n- Has roughly 6 acres of woods, interspersed by:\n- Chicago Area Mountain Bikers (CAMBr) has mountain bike trails there with ramps and jumps, right in the middle of the woods. They call it 'The Garden' on their website. It's still a work in progress, but they intend to have some small hills and jumps for all levels eventually\n- The City is going to build underpasses so bicyclists can ride along the Chicago River. Eventually it will connect to the trail up north, which will eventually connect to the North Branch Trail to the Botanic Gardens\n- There is a new dock for canoes/kayaks, etc. to launch from\n- They have rowing clubs based in their new boat house, which includes indoor rowing facilities\n- There is a new soccer field across the steet, and the a new baseball field called Kerry Woods Cubs Field, sponsored by...?\n\nAnd those are just what has been built or confirmed. Let's help them get their woods healthy!",

Many unusual and unlikely plants abound in these fragile and bluffy lakeside habitats. We'll explore a couple spectacular examples of glacial ice age remnant flora in one of Illinois’s last natural drainage systems to the lake. \n\nOUR STARTING POINT HAS CHANGED. PLEASE RSVP BY EMAIL and Michael will provide you with the new meeting location. From there, we will travel to two or three ravines nearby to explore the spectacular spring flora that lives there. Come learn about the unique plants that live in these ecosystems and the restoration projects underway to preserve and maintain these precarious habitats.\n\nOn the way back home, we'll head over to Lake Bluff Brewing Company to enjoy some local brews of the vicinity.\n\nTo RSVP: \n\nPlease RSVP with an email to mswierz AT gmail.com to let us know you are coming, so we can plan accordingly. Due to space constraints in the ravines and the fragile nature of the ecosystem, it is possible we may need to limit the number of attendees for this event. Should this be the case, preference will be given to whomever has RSVP'd by email first.\n\nTo learn more about the ravines: \n\nhttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/2009-06-25/travel/chi-brotman-090910-rareplants-story_1_ravines-lakeshore-preserve-openlands\n\n\nTo carpool:\n\nCarpooling is encouraged! Save gas and the planet and make new friends!\n\nNeed a ride or just want to carpool? Join our carpool list at habitat2030.org/carpool\"\n\n\nTo take public transportation:\n\nTransportation to this event is also available via the Metra Union Pacific North line. Please let us know if you planning on taking the train and we can arrange to pick you up at the Fort Sheridan Metra station (located one mile from the preserve).",

Steward Erin Faulkner will show us how to hunt for signs of our animal visitors such as coyotes, skunks, rabbits, ducks, songbirds, & prairie crayfish.\n\nPerhaps a stop at Ten-Nintey Breweing Company in Glenview will be in order after we finish our hard work learning plants and ecosystems. It's 10 minutes away by car at 1025 Waukegan Road, Glenview, IL 60025\n\nExtra parking is available across Milwaukee Ave. at the Savers thrift store.

   "description": "What a name for an activity! \n\nWe will don our wellies and go deep into the Somme Woods ponds to search for salamander larvae (colloquially called \"sallywogs\"). This activity will delight your curiosity, but it has a very important scientific purpose. We want to find out if our salamanders are reproducing effectively and if their populations are increasing year by year. To find that out we need to look for sallywogs each spring, starting.... now! We'll do this for years to come and voila data!\n\nWe recommend wearing rain boots or waders if you have them in your wardrobe. Waterproof pants are also helpful, but of course they don't protect your socks from getting wet. \n\nPlease do not wear sunscreen or bug spray anywhere that will contact the water. If you apply it to your face and neck (of course we recommend protecting yourself from sunburn) please wash your hands before you come so you do not get it in the water. Please also scrub down your boots to remove all mud collected from other forest preserves or your garden, then spritz them or dip them in rubbing alcohol or hydrogen peroxide. These precautions are necessary to protect this delicate ecosystem from contamination by salamander and frog killing fungi and pollutants. \n\nPlease contact cecil hynds riddle at gmail dot com with questions.\n\n",

   "description": "We all know that Illinois is the \"Prairie State\". But how many of us have actually stood in a vast, expansive grassland and truly felt the sublime exaltation of the prairie?\n\nNOW IS YOUR CHANCE\n\nBartel Grassland, a nearly 600 acre preserve in southern Cook County, is a rarity in our highly urbanized landscape. It has the size to support populations of rare grassland-nesting birds and to inspire awe in the minds and hearts of humans.\n\nOnly 20 minutes from downtown Chicago, Bartel is a place of great ecological importance. It is one of a handful of sites in the Chicago region that can truly give us a glimpse into the past. To stand in the middle of the Bartel prairie is to look back to a time when vast herds of bison and passenger pigeons called Chicago home. \n\nHabitat 2030 will be working at the edge of the prairie, in the Bartel Shrubland. Shrublands are important, little-understood ecosystems that once were much more common. They provide integral habitat to many rare plants and animals. We'll be working to clear invasive brush and trees in the hopes of enhancing this precious habitat. \n\nHabitat 2030 has never done a workday in this part of the region. We KNOW there are many young, interested, and eager restorationists out there. We're relying on YOU to help spread the word and generate interest in the site. \n\nMeet in the Bartel Grassland parking lot on Flossmoor Rd.: https://goo.gl/maps/wW8TV\n\nFrom there, we'll hike up to the shrubland and get to work, sawing, lopping, laughing, and eating alongside a raging bonfire. \n\nAs always, EXPERIENCE IS NOT REQUIRED. We are trying to develop the next generation of volunteer stewards of the land, and all are welcome!\n\nPlease bring a water bottle and weather-appropriate clothes. Gloves and tools will be provided. As always, please avoid wearing synthetic clothing, as embers from the fire can burn holes in the fibers. \n\nFor questions the day of, contact Daniel Suarez at 773-415-3197. \n\nIf you're interested in carpooling, comment below and let's start the conversation!",

This time we are meeting at the Flossmoor Station Restaurant & Brewery in the south suburbs (set up a carpool by commenting on this event). As we choose a new book we will also choose a new meeting locaiton so we can be geographically fair to eveyone.\n\nRead the book. Bring questions and thoughtful comments. No pressure. Just fun.\n\nFor our first meeting we wil be reading John Schwegman's new book \"The Natural Heritage of Illinois Essays on Its Lands, Waters, Flora, and Fauna\"\n\nJohn E. Schwegman is the principal author of The Natural Divisions of Illinois, a classification of the state’s natural lands that guides the development of the Illinois Nature Preserves System. He established the Natural Areas Program (now Division of Natural Heritage) at the Illinois’ Department of Natural Resources and since retirement has served as a commissioner of the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission. He led the founding of the Natural Areas Association, America's professional society for nature conservationists, and served as its first President. Currently, he serves as a consultant to the Illinois Nature Preserves Commission.\n\nHabitat 2030 tie-in: John was an important figure in the 1980s and 90s when he did the first floristic survey of Langham Island. He along with others started intensive managment there to save the Kankakee Mallow. #ConservationHero Links to buy the book, read a preview, check out reviews: \nSIU press: http://siupress.com/product/Natural-Heritage-of-Illinois,6359.aspx \nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Heritage-Illinois-Essays-Waters/dp/0809334844\n\nHope to see you there!",

   "description": "Welcome to Habitat 2030's new book club: \"Leaf Litter.\" \n\nEveryone is welcome and we hope to do this once every couple months with a new book. This time we are meeting at the Daniel Suarez's apartment in Chicago's Ukrainian Village neighborhood (set up a carpool by commenting on this event). As we choose a new book we will also choose a new meeting locaiton so we can be geographically fair to everyone.\n\nRead the book. Bring questions and thoughtful comments. No pressure. Just fun.\n\nThis time around we are reading \"Reading the Landscape of America\" by May Thielgaard Watts. May studied with Henry Chandler Cowles, the godfather of ecology, and she was the first to explain the theory of plant succession to the general public. May worked at the Morton Arboretum for many years as a naturalist, and led the charge to establish the Illinois Prairie Path. \n\nYou can purchase the book here, although we do encourage you to buy from a local bookstore if possible: https://www.amazon.com/Reading-Landscape-America-Theilgaard-Watts/dp/0912550236 \n\nIn particular, we will focus on the following chapters: \n\n4. Picnic in a Gritty Wind, or The Sand Dunes of Indiana\n5. History Book with a Flexible Cover, or The Records in a Quaking Bog\n6. Prairie Plowing Match, or The Making and Breaking of the Tall Grass Sod\n10. Camp Sites, Fires, and Cud-Chewers, or How the Upland Forest Changes, Illinois to Wisconsin\n\nBring your thoughts, something to drink and/or a snack to share!\nCall Daniel at 773-415-3197 to be let in. \n\nHope to see you there!",

   "description": "What would be the PERFECT Leaf Litter Book Club book for January 2017? Why, \"Winter World\" by Bernd Heinrich. Some of you have no doubt read this classic already, and some of you are going to be thrilled to have this be your introduction to it. \n\nFor this Habitat 2030 Leaf Litter event find us in the back dinning room of The Piggery on 1625 West Irving Park Road. About a mile from Lake Shore Drive, just a bit west of Wrigley Field, at about Ashland and Irving Park. I was just here for a Birds & Beers event with COS, and the service is great, I like the food a lot, the beer is excellent, and they are willing to give us what space we need and keep the room quiet for our book club. \n\nAs we will not be able to discuss every chapter in detail, I have selected 7 chapters to have us focus our discussion on... but am open to any other suggestions as I finalize my list. I will share those chapters with you two weeks out if you haven't had a chance to read the whole book. I will tell you one of the chapters WILL be \"Frozen Frogs on Ice,\" 'cause, COME ON!, how is that possible?\n\nQuestions? Feel free to contact host, Jeff Skrentny at SkrentnySpeaks@me.com or by text message at 773.677.8852.\n\nFacebook event: https://www.facebook.com/events/146844645803279/",

Help clear Secret Prairie Savanna (south east corner of the site) with the smells of brats, green peppers and onions wafting and baked potatoes roasting on the brush pile fire while we work. Please bring a side dish you'd like to share! At the edge of the Valparaiso Moraine, Orland Grassland is 960 acres of rolling prairie, swales, streams, ponds, wetland, oak savanna and shrubland. Meet up at the White Mountain golf course on 179th Street just west of La Grange Road in Orland Park. ",
